# Unicamper
Unicamper is a website that allows international students without any camping experience in Victoria, get started with camping. 

## Components
Unicamper has two high level components, the client and the server. You need to run them both locally for future development. Run the server first and then run the client. 
You may need to change the server URL in ```client/src/services/API.js```

### Running the server
```javascript
npm install
npm start
```

### Running the client
```javascript
npm install
npm run dev
```
